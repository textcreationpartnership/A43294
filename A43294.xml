            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE Chriſtian Readers.</head>
            <p>PRayer is the moſt comprehenſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Religious Worſhip, which we all ought to give unto God from our Youth up, and (to ſay nothing of its other Benefits,) of greateſt influence into a good and vertuous life. It is great pity therefore that any ſhould neglect thus to Honour God and profit themſelves, for want of ſome plain and uſeful help for the due performance of it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that ſtand moſt in need of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance this way, are the younger and more ignorant ſort of People, Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: whoſe Capacities are well to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of: That neither their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be confounded with things above their reach, nor their memories over-burthened with too great a length or variety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109945:3"/>
And, for ſuch as theſe, methinks nothing can be more appoſite than the pious and wholeſome Direction of a Reverend Divine in his late Treatiſe of Prayer, <hi>That they would learn the Lords Prayer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Bright <hi>Treat. of Prayer,</hi> Cap 5. Sect. 19. p. 387.</note> with the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, and the ſum of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Church Catechiſm turned into Prayer, and other ſhort comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Forms: and that Parents would be careful to teach their Children ſuch, and ſee they ſay them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of which Excellent Advice, I do heartily recommend the enſuing Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to all whoſe hearts God ſhall incline to make uſe of it: where I have prefixed the open and perſonal Profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf, according to our Baptiſmal Vow; a Point which I conceive of great uſefulneſs in it ſelf, and the greater ſtill, becauſe Confirmation is ſo much neglected.</p>
            <p>This Religious courſe will make the Plain and Godly Principles of the Church
<pb facs="tcp:109945:3"/>Catechiſm (which is too commonly deſpiſed) to take the deeper Root, and ſtick the faſter in the minds and affections of thoſe that have learnt it, and help exceedingly to reduce thoſe fruitful Principles into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: being a continual Monitor both of the threefold Engagement we are under as Chriſtians, and the chief Rules we are taught to obſerve in Order to our diſcharge thereof.</p>
            <p>I will ſay no mare of it farther, but this that it ſeems to me a good expedient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt many extravagancies, which attend Arbitrary and Extempore Devorions: and may poſſibly train up a Generation of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Orderly Chriſtians to ſucceed us.</p>
            <p>Only I muſt admoniſh thoſe who make uſe of this Plat-form, theſe two things in the General.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> That they bethink themſelves what they are going about; namely to Addreſs unto, and Worſhip the Great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, who is preſent with them, though they ſee him not, to behold and obſerve all their carriage: And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:109945:4"/>
               <hi>II.</hi> That they ſay and repeat every clauſe Leiſurely, Gravely, Diſtinctly; and labour to keep their Eyes from wandring, and their Thoughts as intent as may be, to the words they utter; and, as they grow in years, improve in the conſidering more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately of them, and being affected with them.</p>
            <p>And ſo I leave this Charitable Help, intended for Beginners, to their kind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and God Almighty's Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcionable uſe of it.</p>
